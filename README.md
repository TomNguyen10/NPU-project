## Install and Set Up Python Libraries for Ubuntu 22.04 on Khadas Vim3

### Update Packages

First, ensure that all packages are up to date by running the following command:

```bash
sudo apt update
```

````

### Install Python3

Python is a prerequisite for many development tasks. Install Python 3 by executing:

```bash
sudo apt install python3
```

### Remove Redundant Packages

After installing Python, it's a good practice to remove redundant packages to free up disk space:

```bash
sudo apt autoremove
```

### Check Python Version

Verify that Python 3 has been installed correctly and check its version:

```bash
python3 --version
```

### Install Pip (Python Package Manager)

Pip is a package management system used to install and manage Python packages. Install it with:

```bash
sudo apt install python3-pip
```

### Install Dependencies

Before installing TensorFlow and OpenCV, it's essential to install their dependencies to ensure smooth installation:

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential cmake git unzip pkg-config
sudo apt-get install -y libjpeg-dev libpng-dev libtiff-dev
sudo apt-get install -y libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libswscale-dev
sudo apt-get install -y libgtk2.0-dev libcanberra-gtk*
sudo apt-get install -y python3-dev python3-numpy python3-pip
sudo apt-get install -y libxvidcore-dev libx264-dev libgtk-3-dev
sudo apt-get install -y libatlas-base-dev gfortran
sudo apt-get install -y libhdf5-dev
```

These dependencies are necessary for building TensorFlow and OpenCV with various functionalities.

### Install TensorFlow

Now, let's install TensorFlow. Since you're using an ARM-based machine, you'll need a version specific to that architecture. Install it via pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow-aarch64
```

### Install OpenCV

OpenCV is a popular computer vision library. Install it using the following command:

```bash
sudo apt install python3-opencv
```

After completing these steps, you'll have a fully configured Python environment with TensorFlow and OpenCV on your Khadas Vim3 running Ubuntu 22.04.
